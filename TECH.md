# tech

This project was created with [Better-T-Stack](https://github.com/AmanVarshney01/create-better-t-stack), a modern TypeScript stack that combines React, TanStack Router, Elysia, and more.

## Features

- **TypeScript** - For type safety and improved developer experience
- **TanStack Router** - File-based routing with full type safety
- **TailwindCSS** - Utility-first CSS for rapid UI development
- **Shared UI package** - shadcn/ui primitives live in `packages/ui`
- **Elysia** - Type-safe, high-performance framework
- **Bun** - Runtime environment
- **Drizzle** - TypeScript-first ORM
- **PostgreSQL** - Database engine
- **Authentication** - Better-Auth
- **Electrobun** - Lightweight desktop shell for web frontends
- **Oxlint** - Oxlint + Oxfmt (linting &amp; formatting)
- **Vite+** - Unified Vite toolchain, workspace task runner, linting, and formatting

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

## Database Setup

This project uses PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.

1. Make sure you have a PostgreSQL database set up.
2. Update your `apps/server/.env` file with your PostgreSQL connection details.
3. Apply the schema to your database:

```bash
bun run db:push
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
bun run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) in your browser to see the web application.  
The API is running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## UI Customization

React web apps in this stack use the [https://github.com/g4rcez/components](https://github.com/g4rcez/components) and shadcn/ui primitives through `packages/ui`.

- Avoid to write CSS, prefer the tailwindcss styles
- Change design tokens and global styles in `packages/ui/src/styles/globals.css`
- Update shared primitives in `packages/ui/src/components/*`
- Adjust shadcn aliases or style config in `packages/ui/components.json` and `apps/web/components.json`

### Add more shared components

Run this from the project root to add more primitives to the shared UI package:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add accordion dialog popover sheet table -c packages/ui
```

Import shared components like this:

```tsx
import { Button } from "@zetta/ui/components/button";
```

### Add app-specific blocks

If you want to add app-specific blocks instead of shared primitives, run the shadcn CLI from `apps/web`.

## Environment Configuration

Each app owns its environment schema in `.env.schema`. Varlock generates `src/env.ts` during installation; run `bun run env:generate` after changing a schema. Commit schemas, and keep secrets in ignored env files or your deployment platform.

Import the generated `ENV` accessor in application code. Shared database and auth packages receive configuration or initialized clients from the application. See [Varlock's monorepo guide](https://varlock.dev/guides/monorepos/).

Bun's automatic env loading is disabled in `bunfig.toml`; the framework integration or server bootstrap loads Varlock. Node deployments must include Varlock and its dependencies alongside the app schema.

Run standalone Node/Bun tools that use Varlock from the owning app directory so they load that app's schema and env files. `env:generate` only generates TypeScript files; it does not initialize environment values in a subsequent command.

## Deployment

### Alchemy

- Target: Axiom observability
- Configure provider accounts: `cd packages/infra && bunx alchemy profile edit`
- Dev: bun run dev
- Deploy: bun run deploy:infra
- Destroy: bun run destroy

`alchemy profile edit` stores the selected Axiom, Cloudflare, Neon, PlanetScale, and/or Prisma provider profiles under `~/.alchemy`; no provider-specific setup command is required by this scaffold.

Deploys are staged and default to a personal `dev_<username>` stage. For production, run the deploy with an explicit stage from `packages/infra`:

```bash
cd packages/infra && bunx alchemy deploy --stage production
```

Alchemy creates a stage-specific Axiom dataset and a least-privilege ingest token. `dev` injects the credentials into the observed apps without writing the token to an env file.  
For a deployed Docker image, pass `AXIOM_API_KEY`, `AXIOM_DATASET`, and `AXIOM_EDGE_URL` through the target platform's secret manager. Local observed development runs through Alchemy with the credentials injected in memory.

### Docker Compose

- Target: web + server
- Config: `docker-compose.yml` (app Dockerfiles live in `apps/*/Dockerfile`)
- Build images: bun run docker:build
- Start: bun run docker:up
- Logs: bun run docker:logs
- Stop: bun run docker:down

Environment variables are read from each app's `.env` file (baked into web builds for public variables) and overridden in `docker-compose.yml` for container networking.

For more details, see the guide on [Deploying with Docker Compose](https://www.better-t-stack.dev/docs/guides/docker).

## Git Hooks and Formatting

- Run checks: `bun run check`

## Better Auth Schema Generation

After changing auth plugins or schema options, run `bun run auth:generate` from the project root. The script runs the Better Auth CLI through `varlock run` from the owning app directory, loading the auth instance from `src/services.ts`. Review the schema changes, then use your ORM's migration workflow to apply them.
